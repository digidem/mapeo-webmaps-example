# Mapeo Webmaps Example data

- `metadata.json` contains the title and description that are used for the map.
- `points.json` has all the points, with `title`, `data`, `description` and
  `image`, which must match the filename of the corresponding image in the
  `images` folder.

To prepare for upload to https://maps.mapeo.world/ create a Zip archive from all
the files. On Mac: select all the files (`metadata.json`, `points.json` and the
`images` folder), right-click, and select "Create Archive". Then rename the file
replacing the `.zip` with `.mapeomap`. It is then ready to upload.
